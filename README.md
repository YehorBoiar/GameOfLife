# P2: Game of Life

## Workflow

For implementing a new big feature you should create a new branch and do it there.

```git 
git branch <branchName>
git checkout <branchName>
```

When you finish implementing your featrure and you think that it can go to the master branch 
```git 
git checkout master
git merge <branchName>
```

And don't forget to commit your code as you go :)

```git 
git add <filename>
git commit -m "Thoughtful message"
```
